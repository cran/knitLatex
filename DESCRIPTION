Package: knitLatex
Title: 'Knitr' Helpers - Mostly Tables
Version: 0.9.0
Authors@R: person("John", "Shea", email = "coachshea@fastmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides several helper functions for working with 'knitr' and 'LaTeX'.
  It includes 'xTab' for creating traditional 'LaTeX' tables, 'lTab' for generating
  'longtable' environments, and 'sTab' for generating a 'supertabular' environment.
  Additionally, this package contains a knitr_setup() function which fixes a
  well-known bug in 'knitr', which distorts the 'results="asis"' command when used
  in conjunction with user-defined commands; and a com command (<<com=TRUE>>=)
  which renders the output from 'knitr' as a 'LaTeX' command.
